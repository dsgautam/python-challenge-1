# **Assignment: Module-2 Challenge**
## **Github Repository: Python-Challenge-1**

### 1. **Solution Approach**
The menu items with categories of food and their prices are provided in the form of dictionary items. The requirement is to write a python code to:

a. Accept customer's menu order of food and drinks selection  
b. Identify the price of each item selected and quanity desired  
c. Calculate the total price of the order  
d. Print the order 
e. Provide appropriate guidance or error messages as an aid to the customer in the menu selection  

### 2. **Testing** 
The program was writtent iteratively to test out the various parts of the applications. Print statement was used liberally to understand the flow of the program, and check if the logic holds true in all conditions. Attention was also given to caputre the various errors the customer may run into, knowingly or unknowingly, when making choices
During the final solution deployments, most of the irrelevant print statements are removed, however in this case I have left some to guide the reviewer of the results of the application logic. 

### 3. **Error Handling** 
The programer has taken the liberty to annotate the error messages with a number to easily locate the location from where error messages are generated.
